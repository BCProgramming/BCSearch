Devlog for BASeSearch Application.


Created July 14th, 2009


Just wanted to record: I needed to change the VBAccelerator Listview ImageList Property Code, so that I could use a system imagelist. I simply changed one Procedure from accepting a Object to accepting a Long value...

I added Tags to a few other objects, too. And Of course changed the library name to VBABClListView6 or something.
